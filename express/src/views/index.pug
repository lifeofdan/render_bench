         h1(class="text-center") Making it simple to deliver courses online 👩🏽‍🏫
         p.
            Have you ever wanted to run an online course but been overwhelmed 
            with the complexity of setting up or using the software? Well, it 
            may be time to give Courseable a try.
         p Here as some of the reasons we think you will like our software.
         h2 Easy to use
         p.
            We believe in making software that is simple to use. We don't 
            believe in implementing features that are too complex for you to 
            actually use. Our job is to make complex tasks into a simple ui that 
            you will enjoy using and will help you concentrate on delivering 
            great material.
         h2 Free as in freedom
         p.
            Our team has grown up with open source at our finger tips. Open 
            source provided great tools for learning and building. Later in 
            life, these same tools provided an income. Therefore, we have a 
            passion to deliver open source tools for the next generation.
         h2 Free as in price
         p.
            Courseable is open source. Because of that it would be crazy to
            charge for it. You could just fork it and move on with your day. 
            That being said, we may look for different payment models 
            for services that we could provide in the future if the software 
            grows in popularity. After all, servers aren't free and our families 
            have to eat 😁. 
         h2 Built on modern standards 
         p.
            Many learning platforms are built on old languages and with old 
            stacks that are frankly, just not much fun to work with. Because 
            Courseable is a new project we have the luxury of building using 
            modern tech. This means our software is "<em>Blazingly fast</em>" 
            ⚡ and we hope that you notice how snappy and responsive our 
            software is.
